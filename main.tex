% ABSTRACT
%%%%
\begin{abstract}
% Motivation: introductory 1-2 sentences
As back pain tops the list of all reported work-related disorders, it is a severe, but common constraint, that reduces the quality of life. 
% Problem statement
Therefore it is crucial to instrumentalise motivational prevention tools and education to preserve employees from developing back pain.
% Approach
One approach on reducing the risk of back pain is to increase healthy postural habits. Therefore we designed BodyPose for work environments involving PC/Laptop usage. It is a web app, that evaluates the user's body posture via webcam and gives feedback if an unhealthy misalignment is detected.
% Results
Due to the notifications, users feel immediately motivated to correct a bad posture and maintain a healthy body alignment. Furthermore, users stated that, they feel an overall awareness on increasing/maintaining positive postural habits as a long term motivation.
% Conclusions
Therefore BodyPose qualifies as an effective application to encourage users to work on their body posture and prevent them from developing back pain due to slouching habits.
